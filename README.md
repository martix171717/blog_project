# blog_project

Welcome to my first blog!

The requirements.txt file contains all the modules that are needed for the application to work properly.

Initially, you can test the application with the attached database: blog.db 

It's a website where the author can add some posts, edit or delete them.

Reading posts and searching interesting query is available for all users.

Commands such as add, edit or delete are available only after logging in.

In config.py you can find necessary username and password to log in.

There is my Heroku website:https://mart-blog.herokuapp.com/
